    Computes and returns the amount of radiation exposed
    to between the start and stop times. Calls the 
    function f (defined for you in the grading script)
    to obtain the value of the function at any point.

    stop: integer, the time at which exposure ends
    step: float, the width of each rectangle. You can assume that
